# Cadence-Hspice

Design Instructions: NCSU's FreePDK15

Design Technology: 15nm design Library

Using Cadence Virtuoso, Layouts are designed and Design Flow steps like DRC, LVS and PEX are performed. Hspice is used to simulate the circuits.
Transient, AC and DC analysis are extracted and verified.

Layouts Designed: Inverter, NAND, Ring Oscillator and 6T SRAM Cell

NOTE: Layout Designs and Hspice files are included.
